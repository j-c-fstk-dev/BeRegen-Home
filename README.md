**BeRegen** is a non-profit foundation dedicated to building and stewarding open-source infrastructure for the regenerative economy. Our mandate is to research, develop, and maintain public goods that empower individuals and communities to create positive environmental and social impact.

This repository contains the source code for the main web portal, which serves as the central gateway to the entire BeRegen ecosystem.

## The BeRegen Ecosystem

The BeRegen ecosystem is a suite of interconnected platforms and tools designed to facilitate a transition towards a more sustainable and regenerative culture.

| :--- | :--- |
| 🌳 **BeRegen App** | A productivity app that weaves regenerative habits into your daily life. |
| 🌐 **RegenHub** | A verification and certification platform for real-world impact, powered by AI and community curation. |
| 🏦 **RegenFund DAO** | A decentralized autonomous organization that finances real-world impact projects, governed by the community. |
| 🎬 **RegenFlix** | An educational platform featuring engaging micro-docs, series, and short courses on regenerative topics. |
| 🛍️ **RegenStore** | A curated marketplace where every purchase of sustainable goods helps fund regenerative projects. |
| 🏛️ **Foundation** | The non-profit entity that provides legal grounding, stewards the vision, and supports the ecosystem's development. |
